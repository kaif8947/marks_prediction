Marks Prediction Model
This project predicts a student's marks based on the number of hours they study using a simple regression model.

Features
Input: Number of hours studied.
Output: Predicted marks.
Technology: Uses regression techniques to analyze the relationship between study time and marks.
Objective
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that demonstrates the correlation between study time and performance, helping students forecast their expected marks based on the hours they have studied.

Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn (for model building)
Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)
Installation and Usage
Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and predict marks.
